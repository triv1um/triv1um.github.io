I'm currently a first year Ph.D. student at [Hong Kong Polytechnic Universtiy](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). As a member of [The Little Design Lab](https://www.littledesign.org/), I'm advised by [Prof.Junnan Yu](http://www.junnanyu.com/). As a HCI researcher, my research interests center on human-machine collaboration, embodied interaction, and tangible interfaces.

Short bio: I received my Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Design (B.E.) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University (Future Laboratory) in 2023. Previously, I spent a lovely exchange semester majoring in Interactive Media Technology and Product Design at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

## Research Interests

My research interests center on human-machine collaboration, embodied interaction, and tangible interfaces. Specifically:

**Human-Machine Collaboration**

I aim to advance systems that enable intuitive collaboration between humans and intelligent machines or robots. This involves exploring interaction modalities, gestures, and interfaces that facilitate seamless teamwork.

**Embodied Interaction**

I am fascinated by multi-sensory and embodied approaches to interaction design. My past projects have explored novel interfaces utilizing smell, sound, touch to influence user perceptions and experiences.

**Tangible Interfaces**

I design and assess tangible systems that bridge the digital and physical worlds through graspable objects and embodied interaction. These tangible interfaces aim to leverage human ability to manipulate physical objects.

My goal is to design and evaluate interactive systems, robots, and products that can enhance human communication and experiences. My background in prototyping, conducting user studies, and analyzing interaction data allows me to take a human-centered and evidence-based approach. I am driven by the vision of fluid, intuitive, and empathetic collaboration between humans and machines.
